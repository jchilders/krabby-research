# Krabby Research - Technology and Terminology

## Project Overview

**Krabby Research** specifically focuses on training legged robots to perform extreme parkour locomotion. The project is built on top of NVIDIA's Isaac Lab framework and implements a teacher-student reinforcement learning approach to enable robots to navigate complex, dynamically generated parkour terrains.

The project is based on the Extreme-Parkour research (https://extreme-parkour.github.io/), which demonstrates how legged robots can learn to perform challenging parkour maneuvers through simulation-based training. The system trains two types of policies:

1. **Teacher Policy**: A privileged policy that has access to full state information and terrain knowledge
2. **Student Policy**: A more realistic policy that uses only visual observations (depth images) and proprioceptive data, trained via knowledge distillation from the teacher

  - Is easy to embed in both IsaacLab and lightweight Jetson containers without bringing in a full robotics middleware stack
  - Is friendlier to automated agents modifying the codebase
  - Provides low-latency, high-throughput messaging suitable for real-time control loops (100+ Hz)
  - Supports both local (inproc) and distributed (tcp) communication patterns
- **ZMQ Architecture**: The HAL client/server pair uses two main ZMQ patterns:
  - **Observation** (server PUB / client SUB): One topic; payload is a serialized **`HardwareObservations`** blob (joint/base state, optional primary RGB-D, optional scan features, optional side slot fields, optional **`rgbd_by_catalog_id`** for every HAL-opened RGB-D stream—see **HAL_GUIDE.md**)
  - **Joint commands** (client PUSH / server PULL): Desired joint positions with FIFO ordering and backpressure (HWM=5)

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation between simulation, training, and deployment:

### Core Training Architecture

1. **Environment Layer** (`parkour/parkour_isaaclab/envs/`): Defines the RL environment with managers for actions, observations, rewards, and terminations
2. **Terrain Layer** (`parkour/parkour_isaaclab/terrains/`): Generates diverse parkour terrains programmatically
3. **RL Layer** (`parkour/scripts/rsl_rl/`): Implements the training algorithms, neural networks, and training loops
4. **Task Configuration** (`parkour/parkour_tasks/`): Defines specific task configurations for different robot models and training scenarios
5. **Assets** (`assets/`): Contains robot URDF models and other static assets

### Runtime & Hardware Abstraction Architecture

The project implements a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) using ZMQ for communication, enabling the same parkour policy to run on both simulation and real hardware:

1. **Game Loop (Inference Logic)**: 
   - The core inference logic that runs independently from simulation/hardware
   - Implements a control loop at 100+ Hz that:
     - Polls HAL for latest data (navigation commands, observations)
     - Builds observation tensors matching the training format
     - Runs policy inference to generate joint commands
     - Sends joint commands back via ZMQ
   - Production Jetson HAL process: `python -m hal.server.jetson.main` (see **JETSON_DEPLOYMENT.md**); policy/control loops use **`compute.parkour.inference_client.ParkourInferenceClient`** or project-specific runners that talk to the same HAL ZMQ endpoints
   - Testing: `compute/testing/inference_test_runner.py` (development harness around **`ParkourInferenceClient`**)

2. **HAL Client**:
   - ZMQ-based client that subscribes to observation (camera, state) and sends commands
   - Maintains latest-only buffers to avoid stale data
   - Supports both `inproc://` (local) and `tcp://` (network) transports

3. **HAL Server Interface**:
   - Generic base class defining the ZMQ contract (topics, message formats, endpoints)
   - Ensures consistent communication semantics across all backends

4. **IsaacSim HAL Server**:
   - Runs inside IsaacLab process
   - Publishes camera frames and robot state from simulation
   - Receives joint commands and applies them to the simulated robot
   - Uses the same observation/action semantics as training

5. **Jetson HAL Server**:
   - Runs on Jetson Orin hardware (JetPack/L4T - see Embedded Hardware section for details)
   - Publishes **`HardwareObservations`**: robot state plus front RGB-D from the catalog primary row (commonly **ZED 2i** or **MaixSense-A075V**), and optional extra RGB-D under **`rgbd_by_catalog_id`** when configured (`hal/server/jetson/sensor_backend_jetson.py`)
   - Receives joint commands for real actuators
   - Mirrors the IsaacSim server interface for seamless switching

This architecture allows the parkour policy to be completely decoupled from the execution backend, enabling:
- Development and testing in simulation
- Deployment to real hardware with minimal changes
- Easy switching between simulation and hardware via configuration
- Future extensibility to additional backends or communication patterns

## Key Features

- **Parallel Simulation**: Runs thousands of environments simultaneously for efficient data collection
- **Privileged Learning**: Teacher policy uses full state information for faster learning
- **Visual Learning**: Student policy learns from depth images, making it more transferable to real robots
